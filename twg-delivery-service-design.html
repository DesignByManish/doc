                    <h1>The Warehouse Group delivery service design</h1>
                    
                    <p>The Warehouse Group (TWG) is one of the largest retailing groups in New Zealand. TWG consists of multiple retail brands: The Warehouse, Warehouse Stationery, Noel Leeming, Torpedo7 and others.  
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>The goal of this project was rolling-out additional delivery options to online and in-store customers. As the experience lead on this omni-channel and group-wide project, I worked with the business stakeholders to broaden the vision and extend the goal towards improving the e2e service of delivering products to our customers, while rolling-out additional delivery options. This was a great learning experience for me as I worked closely with stakeholders into coaching and shifting their mindset to a customer focussed strategy. While working on this, I spent most of my last year at TWG helping build service design practice. Some of the highlights included –

                        <li>Helping identify &amp; solve business problems through service design, while improving business processes.</li>
                        
                        <li>Mapping current state &amp; future state of e2e omni-channel journeys and creating service blueprints for an integrated and connected customer experience.</li>
                    
                        <li>Conducting cross functional workshops – service blueprint workshop, bodystorming, ideation sessions, 3-day design sprint – to identify priorities, test omni-channel experiences and ideate solutions.</li>
                    
                        <li>Planning and executing all phases of the design process – discovery, vision, prototype &amp; test and collaborating with the development and wider design team to implement the vision.</li>

To ensure we had inputs from the subject matter experts on all the parts of customer and staff journey, I conducted a workshop with a cross-functional team representing fulfilment, logistics, contact centre and store staff – together with the business and technology stakeholders. The outcome of this workshop was a draft future-state blueprint of delivery service, which we iterated and refined as we moved forward in the project.

                <h2>Omni-channel experience design</h2>
                    <p>While working on this project, I created a slightly customised TWG service blueprint framework which was later used across various omnichannel projects. It proved to be a valuable tool to collaborate with and coach other SMEs on thinking across e2e customer &amp; staff journeys. Considering the various systems involved across the journey, the blueprint also helped aid the discussion about system architecture and how the integration was going to be.  
                    </p>
                    <p>Service blueprints are a great way to dive into the details of an omnichannel experience, although most times communicating the vision in a simpler form really helps in bringing the stakeholders and wider team on the experience design journey. With that goal, I collaborated with another designer to translate the vision into a storyboard.

                <h2>Concept test</h2>
                    <p>Once the stakeholders were onboard with the vision, we tested 2 initial concepts of the new process and experience. We conducted concept testing on a low-fidelity wireframe prototype of the online journey with 7 users to get early feedback on the long term vision. Similarly, we talked to store team members to get feedback on the in-store journey and point-of-sale screen prototype.

                <h2>Bodystorming workshop</h2>
                    <p>While testing the actual digital touchpoints across both channels was extremely insightful, testing the actual e2e delivery process was going to be crucial in identifying various scenarios in the journey. With this goal and also to take all the departments &amp; staff members on the design journey, we conducted a bodystorming workshop with a cross functional team. Bodystorming is an excellent method of testing an e2e omnichannel journey and multiple touchpoints, plus makes for a really fun workshop. The idea is to imagine what it would be like if the product existed, and act as though it exists, ideally in the place it would be used. Enacting the entire journey was helpful in discovering and identifying possible gaps in the service, which was not visible in theory on paper.

                    <p>This project was a great experience for me, and an opportunity for me to learn and build service design practice at TWG. I was grateful to receive positive feedback from the team, the business stakeholders and the senior leaders – mentioning the impact of the collaborative and design thinking led way of working on the digital transformation strategy.
